When you go to load up the application, you will need to run soem commands first.
Commands to run in the terminal:
    export FLASK_APP=main.py
    flask run
Once you run the commands, it should tell you how to access the application.
The usual seems to be 127.0.0.1:5000
Once you get on the login screen, you will need to create an account by clicking the create account button.
From there you will enter in your username, email, and password.
After clicking continue, a one time password will be sent to your email that you will need to enter in.
You will be redirected back to the login page where you will login.
The main page shows what it would look like if you had a team or statistic favorited, but it would normally be empty the first time you login.
The main area we have functioning at the moment is the teams section where you can sort by confrerence and each team has offensive and defensive stats to view.
The other area with content is the Team Comparison, but it shows one graph to show what it would look like when it is funcitonal.
Once you are done, you can logout.
